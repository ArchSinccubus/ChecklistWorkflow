      <Tips text="Be sure to actually DO this excersice! You need to get good, you won't be able to make anything pretty if you slack off on figure drawing! Remember, it's not as crucual to get anatomy right, as much as getting the *figure* right. Get the flow of the character, not her pefect anatomy. Then, if you have the time, get the basic shapes down."/>
